# Preprocessing-website-api-json-data-for-NLP
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on preprocessing movie descriptions for subsequent NLP projects. The preprocessing steps include data acquisition, text preparation, and normalization to prepare the data for advanced natural language processing tasks.

Steps Included:
1. Data Acquisition
Retrieving the Data from API: Fetching movie descriptions from a specified API.
Converting JSON Data to DataFrame: Transforming the retrieved JSON data into a structured pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.
2. Text Preparation
Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to maintain consistency.
Removing HTML Tags and URLs: Cleaning the text by removing any HTML tags and URLs.
Removing Punctuations: Stripping away punctuation marks from the text.
Changing Short Chat Words: Expanding common chat abbreviations (e.g., "u" to "you").
Spelling Corrections: Correcting any spelling errors in the text.
Removing Stop Words: Eliminating common stop words that do not contribute significant meaning.
Replacing Emojis with Their Meanings: Converting emojis into their corresponding text representations.
Tokenizing: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form to ensure uniformity.
This notebook provides a comprehensive pipeline for cleaning and preparing movie descriptions for various NLP tasks. The preprocessing steps ensure that the text data is in a suitable format for further analysis and modeling.
